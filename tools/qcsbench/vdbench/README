Prerequisite:
-------------
 - activate your virtual environment (having python3.5 and other modules in
   it). other modules can be installed from qcs_framework's repo
   requirements.txt as: pip install -r requirements.txt 
 - cd to qcs-automation directory
 - add PYTHONPATH details by sourcing env.sh

Usage:
------
 - cd to tools/qcsbench/vdbench directory
 - update necessary details for executing vdbench in config.py
 - start vdbench: python run.py
 - execution details will be dispalyed on screen and also preserved in LOG_DIR
   specified in config.py
 - suppose you executed with LOG_DIR = 'output', then after execution you
   will find below file and directory under 'output' created
    vdbench_stdout.log 192.168.105.157
   vdbench_stdout.log - log displayed on screen
   192.168.105.157 - this ip will be different for you. it's master host ip
   where vdbench has executed and contains vdbench logs.
